Symbol Explanation\n\nTable: Explanation of Common Cryptographic Symbols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n||\nRepresents string concatenation, meaning that two or more strings are concatenated from left to right.\n\n\n\\(\\oplus\\)\nRepresents the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation. It operates on two binary numbers (or bits): if the corresponding bits are the same, the result is 0; if they are different, the result is 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)\nGiven a finite cyclic group $G = g $ and an element \\(a \\in G\\), the discrete logarithm problem is to find an integer \\(x\\) (where \\(0 \\leq x \\leq |G|\\)) such that \\[ g^x = a \\] .\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User/SCR\n    participant Server\n\n    User/SCR -&gt;&gt; Server: Request Registration\n    Server --&gt;&gt; User/SCR: Initialize Smart Card (SC)\n    User/SCR -&gt;&gt; Server: Complete Smart Card (SC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECC The Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) is a type of public-key cryptography based on the mathematics of elliptic curves. It leverages the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves to achieve functions such as data encryption, decryption, and digital signatures. The primary advantage of ECC is that it provides comparable or even higher levels of security with smaller key sizes compared to other methods (such as the RSA encryption algorithm). This means that for the same level of security, ECC requires fewer computational resources and less storage space.\n\nHash Function Hash function can convert inputs of arbitrary lengths into fixed-length outputs, achieving a many-to-one mapping. For a given hash function, \\(Hash\\), and any fingerprint, \\(c\\), it is nearly impossible to find an input, \\(m\\), such that \\(Hash(m) = c\\). This means that while it is easy to convert an input value into its corresponding output, it is extremely difficult to do the reverse."

    "text": "Background\nIn 1981, Lamport(Lamport 1981) proposed a password-based authentication scheme, where the server stores passwords. This scheme is vulnerable to passive attacks, as once the password table is leaked or compromised, the intruder can modify the passwords stored in the system. Later, Hwang et al. (Hwang, Chen, and Laih 1990) proposed an improved protocol that overcame the weaknesses of Lamport’s scheme. Subsequently, Yang and Shieh (Yang and Shieh 1999) introduced two password authentication schemes using smart cards based on timestamps and nonces."
